# Heston European Option Pricing Engine

## Repository Description

This repository contains a hardware-accelerated implementation of the Heston stochastic volatility model for pricing European call and put options. The code is written in C++ and optimized for synthesis on Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGAs using Vitis HLS. The implementation uses Monte Carlo simulation with parallel random number generators to compute option prices efficiently in hardware.

## Basic Financial Concepts

### What is an Option?

An option is a financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.

- Call Option: The right to buy an asset at a specified price
- Put Option: The right to sell an asset at a specified price
- European Option: Can only be exercised on the expiration date (not before)

### Key Variables

#### Stock Parameters

**S0 (Initial Stock Price)**
- Current market price of the underlying stock
- Units: Currency (e.g., dollars)
- Example: S0 = 100 means the stock currently trades at $100

**K (Strike Price)**
- The predetermined price at which the option can be exercised
- Units: Currency (e.g., dollars)
- Example: K = 105 means you can buy/sell at $105 regardless of market price

**r (Risk-Free Rate)**
- The theoretical return on a risk-free investment (e.g., government bonds)
- Units: Decimal (e.g., 0.05 = 5% annual return)
- Formula: Future Value = Present Value * exp(r * T)

**T (Time to Maturity)**
- Time remaining until the option expires
- Units: Years
- Example: T = 0.5 means 6 months until expiration

**sigma (Volatility)**
- Measure of how much the stock price fluctuates
- Units: Decimal (e.g., 0.20 = 20% annual volatility)
- Higher volatility means more uncertainty and higher option prices

#### Heston Model Parameters

The Heston model assumes that volatility itself changes randomly over time, following its own stochastic process.

**theta (Long-Term Variance)**
- The average level that variance tends to return to over time
- Units: Variance (volatility squared)
- Example: theta = 0.04 corresponds to 20% long-term volatility

**kappa (Mean Reversion Speed)**
- How quickly volatility returns to its long-term average
- Units: 1/Time
- Higher kappa means faster mean reversion
- Example: kappa = 2.0 means volatility adjusts relatively quickly

**xi (Volatility of Volatility)**
- How much the volatility itself fluctuates
- Units: Square root of variance per square root of time
- Example: xi = 0.3 means moderate fluctuation in volatility

**rho (Correlation)**
- Correlation between stock price changes and volatility changes
- Units: Dimensionless (-1 to +1)
- Typically negative: when stock drops, volatility rises
- Example: rho = -0.5 means moderate negative correlation

### Put-Call Parity

For European options, there exists a fundamental relationship that must hold to prevent arbitrage:

```
C - P = S0 - K * exp(-r * T)
```

Where:
- C = Call option price
- P = Put option price
- S0 = Current stock price
- K = Strike price
- r = Risk-free rate
- T = Time to maturity

This equation states that the difference between a call and put price must equal the difference between the current stock price and the present value of the strike price.

### Option Payoffs

At expiration, the option value depends on the final stock price (ST):

**Call Option Payoff:**
```
Payoff = max(ST - K, 0)
```
- Profitable if ST > K
- Worthless if ST <= K

**Put Option Payoff:**
```
Payoff = max(K - ST, 0)
```
- Profitable if ST < K
- Worthless if ST >= K

Total Simulation Paths:

Default Configuration:
- NUM_RNGS = 2      (parallel RNG instances)
- NUM_SIMGROUPS = 2 (simulation batches per RNG)
- NUM_SIMS = 16     (Monte Carlo iterations)
- NUM_STEPS = 16    (time discretization steps)

Total = 2 * 2 * 16 = 64 parallel paths

## Running the Project

### HLS 

Run Vitis HLS to generate RTL for FPGA implementation:

```bash
source /PATH_TO_VITIS_HLS/2023.2/settings64.sh
vitis_hls run_hls.tcl
```

This performs:
1. C Simulation - Functional verification
2. C Synthesis - RTL generation
3. C/RTL Co-simulation - Hardware verification
4. Export Design - IP packaging

## Test Cases

The test bench includes 6 scenarios:

1. At-The-Money Option (S0 = K = 100)
2. In-The-Money Call (S0 = 110, K = 100)
3. Out-of-The-Money Call (S0 = 90, K = 100)
4. Short Time to Maturity (T = 0.1 years)
5. High Volatility (sigma = 50%)
6. Low Volatility (sigma = 10%)

Each test validates:
- Positive option prices
- Put-Call parity relationship
- Correct relative pricing (ITM > ATM > OTM)

## Expected Accuracy

Put-Call parity errors should be:
- Normal volatility: 0.02 to 0.08 (acceptable)
- High volatility: 0.5 to 1.0 (marginal)
- Target: Less than 0.10 for production use

Typical errors:
- At-The-Money: 0.04 to 0.05
- In/Out-of-The-Money: 0.04 to 0.06
- Short maturity: 0.05 to 0.08
- High volatility: 0.70 to 1.00
